  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general idea of ​​this project is to export certificates in different types of format. As a format, v-om could export certificates in PDF or word and the respective certificates will be exported from the web interface. For the web interface we will make an authentication system so different users will be able to have different permissions depending on the type of user. We will start from an authentication system with user and password, and based on the user and the password, the user type will be identified and a platform related to the user type will be loaded. There will be three types of user, master user, administrator user and end user. For the master user we will be able and will have access to absolutely all the services offered by this platform including a platform that sets and administers news, in fact this will be the main difference between a Master user and an administrator user. For an administrator user we will have the right to create templates, to create end users, to set the related business account and to export documents and certificates. And for an end user, his right is to export only credentials created by the end user's administrator user. The Master user will have the possibility to create global templates, meaning that these templates can and will be the first templates displayed when a business account managed by an administrator user is created.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final goal of this project is to generate documents and certificates necessary in the human resources process for each individual employee automatically, so visits to the human resources department will no longer be necessary as each employee will have an account from which they can export the necessary certificate or document, in this case we will consider the end user to be an employee of a company and the administrator will be a person designated by the human resources department to administer all documents and certificates including the templates for their generation. In creating the platform, we will consider an interface that is as easy to use as possible and intuitive for each individual user
